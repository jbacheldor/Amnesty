  a) all issues are scrapped daily and saved in a database to make quick population of the screen possible
2. The actions related to their selected issues populate the page in a webview
3. Individuals can click on specific issues to fill out the information
4. If students want to sign up at any time they can manually input their information
  a) once they do this their information is pushed to a database to be saved
